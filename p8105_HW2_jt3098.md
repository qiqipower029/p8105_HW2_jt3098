Problem 1
---------

``` r
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
subway_data$entry = ifelse(subway_data$entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
```

This dataset is called subway\_data. The variable it contains are below:

-   line: the avenue or road in NYC that the station located in
-   station\_name: the names of all stations
-   station\_latitude: the latitude value for this station
-   station\_longitude: the longitude value for this station
-   route1:route11: the train that stops at this station
-   entry: whether or not there is entry for this station
-   vending: whether or not there is vending for this station
-   entrance\_type: the type of the entrance
-   ada: whether or not there is ada compliance in this station

Cleaning steps:

-   Import csv file from the data folder
-   Use janitor::clean\_names() function to convert all upper-case letters to lower-case.
-   Use select function to carefully choose columns required to show up in the dataset
-   Use ifelse() function to convert entry variable from character to logical.

-   Dimension: rows: 1868; columns: 19.
-   This dataset is not tidy, because columns in this dataset are not only variables. Also, some of the columns need to be combinded or collapsed.

``` r
distinction = distinct(subway_data, station_name, line)
subway_data %>%  
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 84

``` r
n_entrance_novending = filter(subway_data, entry == "TRUE", vending == "NO") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
n_exit_nonvending = filter(subway_data, entry == "FALSE", vending == "NO") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
```

-   There are 465 distinct stations in NYC.
-   There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.
-   The proportion of non-vending entrance is 0.0924731; the proportion of non-vending exit is 0.1462366

``` r
subway_data_tidy = gather(subway_data, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
```

``` r
A_stations = filter(subway_data_tidy, route_name == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
A_compliant = filter(subway_data_tidy, route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()
```

-   In NYC, 60 distinct stations serve A train, 17 of which are ADA compliant.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
waterwheel_data = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", range = "A2:N256") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
prcp_2016 = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14")
prcp_2017 = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", sheet = 3, range = "A2:B10")

prcp_2016 = 
  prcp_2016 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2016)

prcp_2017 = 
  prcp_2017 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2017)

prcp_data = full_join(prcp_2016, prcp_2017)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

``` r
prcp_data = 
  prcp_data %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

About these data:

-   waterwheel\_data is a dataset exported from HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx sheet 1. It contains many variables to categorize the types of trash that they collected on a specific date. For example, one of the key variable in waterwheel\_data is sports balls. The mean value for sports balls in this dataset is 15.2837209, and the standard deviation of sports balls is 10.4715219.
-   There are 215 records in waterwheel\_data, which implies the times that water wheels were used.
-   In prcp\_data, all the data are from sheet 3 and 4 of HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx. the precipitation was collected in 20 months. The number of months recorded in 2016 is 12 and the number of months recorded in 2017 is 8, respectively.
-   The tatol precipitation in 2017 is 29.93.
-   The median number for sports balls is 8.
