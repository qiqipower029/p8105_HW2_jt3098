Problem 1
---------

``` r
# Import csv data
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% # Upper-case --> Lower-case
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) # Retain variable needed to analyze
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
subway_data$entry = ifelse(subway_data$entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE) # Make entry variable from character to logical data
```

This dataset is called subway\_data. The variable it contains are below:

-   line: the avenue or road in NYC that the station located in
-   station\_name: the names of all stations
-   station\_latitude: the latitude value for this station
-   station\_longitude: the longitude value for this station
-   route1:route11: the train that stops at this station
-   entry: whether or not there is entry for this station
-   vending: whether or not there is vending for this station
-   entrance\_type: the type of the entrance
-   ada: whether or not there is ada compliance in this station

Cleaning steps:

-   Import csv file from the data folder
-   Use janitor::clean\_names() function to convert all upper-case letters to lower-case.
-   Use select function to carefully choose columns required to show up in the dataset
-   Use ifelse() function to convert entry variable from character to logical.

-   Dimension: rows: 1868; columns: 19.
-   This dataset is not tidy, because columns in this dataset are not only variables. Also, some of the columns need to be combinded or collapsed.

``` r
distinction = distinct(subway_data, station_name, line) # Count the total number of stations
subway_data %>%  
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow() # Count the total number of stations with ADA compliance
```

    ## [1] 84

``` r
n_entrance_novending = filter(subway_data, entry == "TRUE", vending == "NO") %>%
  nrow() # Count the total number of entrance without vending
n_nonvending = filter(subway_data, vending == "NO") %>%
  nrow() # Count the total number of Exit-only without vending
```

-   There are 465 distinct stations in NYC.
-   There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.
-   The proportion of non-vending entrance is 0.3770492

``` r
subway_data_tidy = gather(subway_data, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
```

``` r
A_stations = filter(subway_data_tidy, route_name == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow() # Total number of stations that serve A
A_compliant = filter(subway_data_tidy, route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow() # Total number of stations that serve A and are ADA compliant
```

-   In NYC, 60 distinct stations serve A train, 17 of which are ADA compliant.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
# Import data from excel file
waterwheel_data = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", range = "A2:N256") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) # Change column type to integer
```

``` r
# Importing data from exel file
prcp_2016 = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14")
prcp_2017 = read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx", sheet = 3, range = "A2:B10")

prcp_2016 = 
  prcp_2016 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2016) # Add a new variable "year"

prcp_2017 = 
  prcp_2017 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) # Add a new variable "year"

# Join dataset and stored in a new dataset
prcp_data = full_join(prcp_2016, prcp_2017)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

``` r
# Change variable type by using month.name[] function
prcp_data = 
  prcp_data %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

About these data:

-   waterwheel\_data is a dataset exported from HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx sheet 1. It contains many variables to categorize the types of trash that they collected on a specific date. For example, one of the key variable in waterwheel\_data is sports balls. The mean value for sports balls in this dataset is 15.2837209, and the standard deviation of sports balls is 10.4715219.
-   There are 215 records in waterwheel\_data, which implies the times that water wheels were used.
-   In prcp\_data, all the data are from sheet 3 and 4 of HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals.xlsx. the precipitation was collected in 20 months. The number of months recorded in 2016 is 12 and the number of months recorded in 2017 is 8, respectively.
-   The tatol precipitation in 2017 is 29.93.
-   The median number for sports balls is 26.

brfss_2002 = 
  brfss_overallhealth %>%
  filter(year == "2002")
median(brfss_2002$excellent, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 23.6

From this dataset, we could know that:

-   There are 404 different locations are included.
-   There are 51 states are included, so every state is represented. The most observed state is NJ.
-   The median value for excellent response in 2002 is 23.6.

``` r
# make a histogram for "Excellent" response in 2002
ggplot(brfss_2002, aes(x = excellent), alpha = .5) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
