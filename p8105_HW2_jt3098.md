``` r
subway_data$entry = ifelse(subway_data$entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
```

This dataset is called subway\_data. The variable it contains are below:

-   line: the avenue or road in NYC that the station located in
-   station\_name: the names of all stations
-   station\_latitude: the latitude value for this station
-   station\_longitude: the longitude value for this station
-   route1:route11: the train that stops at this station
-   entry: whether or not there is entry for this station
-   vending: whether or not there is vending for this station
-   entrance\_type: the type of the entrance
-   ada: is there ada compliance in this station

``` r
distinction = distinct(subway_data, station_name, line)
```
